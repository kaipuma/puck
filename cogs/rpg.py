		"""
		Roll some number of dice with potential modifiers.
		Each entry is separated by some space. The core of an entry is the dice. This is in the form "XdY", where X and Y are numbers. This will roll X dice with sides numbered 1 through Y.
		Alternatively, the entry core could be in the form "XrM-Y" to specify a "range" of values to be rolled from. X and Y are the same, but M specifies a different minimum value. For example, "3r4-6" will roll three dice, each with faces of 4, 5, and 6.
		Lastly, a "-" may be placed immediately before the entry to negate the result. If the value for X is omitted, the default is 1

		An entry can also have modifiers applied to it. Some examples of this are shown below in the Examples section. Most modifiers have the option to have a number value afterwards. Most of these values default to 1 if not supplied. Any exceptions are noted. The possible modifiers are described here:

		min : Accept only the smallest roll. A supplied value states how many minimum values to accept.
		max : Accept only the largest roll. A supplied value states how many maximum values to accept.
		< : Accept any roll less than (but not equal to) the supplied value.
		> : Accept any roll greater than (but not equal to) the supplied value.
		= : Accept any roll exactly equal to the supplied value.
		<= : Accept any roll less than or equal to the supplied value.
		>= : Accept any roll greater than or equal to the supplied value.
		x : Dice will explode. This rolls an additional die of the same type for every result that is equal to the maximum result. The supplied value can change how many values will explode. For example, a value of 2 will make dice explode on a roll of any of the top 2 possible results.
		xx : Dice will explode, and those dice can explode, as could those, etc. Besides the recursive behavior, this is identical to the "x" modifier.
		num : Instead of summing all the valid results, this will count how many results are valid and use that as the total. This does not accept a value.
		count : Alias for "num"
		pas : This will result in a "success" if any of the dice rolled are accepted, and a "Failure" otherwise. Putting this on multiple parts of a roll requires all to pass.
		success: Alias for "pas"
		+ : This will add the supplied value to the roll as a flat modifier.
		- : This will subtract the supplied value from the roll as a flat modifier.

		In addition to standard rolls, entries can be some special values. An entry consisting of just a number, with an optional "+" or "-" in front is added (or subtracted) from the total as a flat modifier. 
		The last variety of roll is of special dice. These are specified in a configuration file, and may vary. They always come in the form "XdY", however the "d" is some other character(s), and Y may be non-numeric, depending on the special dice used. Results from these dice are summed and displayed separately from the numeric dice and modifiers. No special dice can take any of the above modifiers that numeric dice can.

		Any entry not matching one of the above types is considered a tag. All tags will be put together and displayed at the top of the response.

		Examples:
		2d6 : roll two six sided dice.
		d6 : roll one six sided dice (the first value defaults to 1).
		2d6x : roll 2d6. for every 6 rolled in the initial two dice, roll another d6.
		2d6xx : roll 2d6. for every 6 rolled, roll another d6. if any more 6's are rolled, repeat.
		2d6x3 : same as 2d6x, but roll another d6 for each 6, 5, or 4 rolled.
		2d6max : roll 2d6, but only keep the maximum result.
		4d6max2 : roll 4d6, but only keep the top 2 results.
		2d6min : roll 2d6, but only keep the minimum result.
		2d6>=3 : roll 2d6, but only keep any result greater than or equal to 3.
		2d6>3 : roll 2d6, but only keep any result greater than, but not equal to 3.
		2d6-3 : roll 2d6, then subtract 3 from the total result.
		2d6>=3num : roll 2d6. The result will be however many rolls are >= 3 (either 0, 1, or 2).
		2d6num : since no results were excluded (like with "max" or "<"), this always results in a 2
		2d6 >=3 num : this is invalid, since there are spaces between the dice and the modifiers.
		"2d6 >=3 num" : this is valid, because the whole roll is surrounded by quotes ("").
		"2d6 >= 3 num" : spaces may also occur between modifiers and their values when quoted.
